# Algo-Trading
This is a repository for INFO 4730 at UNT.
It's purpose is to ultimately transform into a full scale project for algorithmic trading on the 'swing level' where stocks can be held for days, weeks, or months at a time. 
Historic and real-time stockdata will be used, the longest being a year with the earliest being the day.
